            <h4>About me</h4>
            <div>
                As a scientist turned software engineer, I am a fast learner, intrigued by the world around me. In addition, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others and using my skills to further benefit humanity. So far in my career, I have become adept
                in the use of C\# and .Net, from everything to command line applications to websites. As well as this, and to fulfil roles ranging from secure logins to machine learning and data science, I have developed a multitude of serverless applications
                with Amazon Web Services. During my spare time, I enjoy developing algorithmic stock trading robots, applying statistical analysis and machine learning to horse races, and blogging.

                            <p>As my first professional role in a relatively small software department, in addition to my daily responsibilities, I found myself learning a number of technologies in a remarkably short space of time. As a result, I am now
                                proficient in .NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and Amazon Web Services (specifically: Lambda, Cognito, API Gateway, Glue, Redshift, S3, Athena, Quicksight, Cloudwatch, EventBridge).</p>
                            <p>Throughout these experiences, I have become proficient in various languages such as C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. My contributions during this time have included (but are not limited to) revamping the label printing
                                system, developing desktop applications for use in quality control, and bolstering the companyâ€™s serverless capabilities through the use of Amazon Web Services and machine learning. This opened many doors for the company
                                to provide new products and services that were not possible to create before.</p>

                            <p>Funded by the European Research Council, I researched the eects of radiation damage on components of the ATLAS experiment, one of four main experiments on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). During this time, I presented my work
                                at the ITk conference in Oxford in 2018, and the Institute of Physics Joint High Energy Particle Physics and Astroparticle Physics conference in London in 2019.</p>
                            <p>My results have also been shown in other meetings around Europe and beyond. However, despite this progress, I ultimately left the PhD to pursue a career in industry.</p>
